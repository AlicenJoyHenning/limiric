## Description

`DamageDetective` is a quality control package for detecting damaged cells in single cell RNA sequencing data, featuring a single function, `DamageDetective`. 

## Quickstart

The fundamental use case of `DamageDetective` is to take raw scRNA-seq alignment files and predict which barcodes are most likely damaged cells. Output comes in the form of a `csv` that will be generated in the `OutputPath`. This will contain all cell barcodes present in the input data alongside a label of _damaged_ or _cell_ given to the barcode by `DamageDetective`. 

Additionally, a `Seurat` object containing only the filtered cells will be available in your local environment whose name is that which is assigned to the function output, for example here it will be `SRR1234567`.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
library(DamageDetective)

# Load example Seurat object from the DamageDetective package
data("test_data", package = "DamageDetective")

# Run the DamageDetective function with the example data
SRR1234567 <- DamageDetective(
     project_name = "test_run",
     filter_rbc   = FALSE,
     seurat_input = test_data,
     output_path  = tempdir()
   )

# Beginning  DamageDetective  analysis for SRR1234567 ...
# ✔ Seurat object created
# ✔ DamageDetective  damaged cell predictions
# ✔ DamageDetective  analysis complete.
```


## Details 

In addition to predicting damaged cells, `DamageDetective` can perform other pre-processing tasks. This includes removing red blood cells, performing ambient RNA correction with the `SoupX` package, and isolating immune cells. It can also be used in combination with the damaged cell detection functionality of the `DropletQC` package.
