Title: Detect Damaged Cells in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data

Description: 
    A quality control tool for high-precision, sample-specific detection of
    damaged cells in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. 
    The core limiric function processes raw scRNA-seq alignment files to predict 
    which barcodes correspond to damaged cells and outputs these 
    predictions in a csv file alongside a filtered Seurat object.
